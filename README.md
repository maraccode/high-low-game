# high-low-game
High low card game built with reactjs, redux and pixijs

React is used for UI on top of canvas, redux keeps game state, pixijs is handling animations.

It is a work in progress, next steps will be adding preloader, on resize listener, richer graphics, even sounds if I don't get lazy :)

I could get sidetracked easily though. Along the way I have come across a number of react / canvas integrations that I was not happy with, they were either integrated poorly or not really integrated, more like living next to each other on same page.
These integrations include pure canvas, phaserjs, createjs, pixijs, threejs, so I just want to create proper starter pack for each of these libs. Not sure if phaser needs react, though. 
I think I'll be starting with threeejs, so watch out for next repos, I'll be pasting links here. 

## Available Scripts
